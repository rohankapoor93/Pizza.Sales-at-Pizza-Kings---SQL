Retrieve the Total Number of Orders Placed: Determine the total volume of orders to measure business performance.

Calculate the Total Revenue Generated from Pizza Sales: Analyze revenue data to assess financial success and growth.

Identify the Highest-Priced Pizza: Find the most expensive pizza to better understand the pricing strategy.

Identify the Most Common Pizza Size Ordered: Analyze customer preferences by identifying which pizza size is most frequently ordered.

List the Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types along with Their Quantities: Determine the most popular pizza varieties to aid in marketing and inventory decisions.

Join the Necessary Tables to Find the Total Quantity of Each Pizza Category Ordered: Combine relevant data to understand the demand for different pizza categories (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian).

Determine the Distribution of Orders by Hour of the Day: Analyze the sales distribution across different hours to optimize staffing, promotions, and operations.

Join Relevant Tables to Find the Category-wise Distribution of Pizzas: Explore how different categories of pizzas perform in terms of sales to guide menu design and customer targeting.

Group the Orders by Date and Calculate the Average Number of Pizzas Ordered per Day: Examine daily sales patterns to understand customer demand over time and predict future sales.

Determine the Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types Based on Revenue: Identify the pizzas that contribute the most to revenue generation, helping to refine product offerings and pricing strategies.

Through these queries, the project aims to provide actionable insights that will support decision-making at Pizza King, ultimately improving customer satisfaction, sales efficiency, and business profitability.
